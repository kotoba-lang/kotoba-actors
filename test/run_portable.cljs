;; The portable suite on nbb — no build step, no JVM.
;;
;; This file is the point of the `.cljc` conversion. Reader conditionals that
;; are never evaluated under `:cljs` are not portability; they are the
;; appearance of it, and a `:cljs` branch nothing runs is a check that cannot
;; fail.
;;
;;   nbb --classpath src:test test/run_portable.cljs
;;
;; ## It does not have to run from the repo root
;;
;; Unlike a library that reads its own `resources/`, this one reads seed EDN
;; from SIBLING west checkouts by absolute path (see `kotoba-actors.config`),
;; so the working directory does not enter into it. Run it from anywhere:
;;
;;   cd /tmp/elsewhere && nbb --classpath <repo>/src:<repo>/test \
;;     <repo>/test/run_portable.cljs
;;
;; ## What needs data and what does not
;;
;; `kotoba-actors.engine-test` builds its rows in memory and exercises the
;; whole query engine — wildcard, `:in`, synthetic edge ids, multi-clause
;; joins — with no filesystem at all. Everything else reads a seed, and needs
;; `KOTOBA_ACTORS_ETZHAYYIM_ROOT` (or the west layout) to find one. Those
;; suites ERROR loudly when the seed is missing; they are not skipped, and
;; nothing here reports a pass on their behalf.
;;
;; Every `deftest`-bearing namespace must be named BOTH in the require and in
;; `run-tests`: requiring registers the vars, only `run-tests` runs them, and
;; a runner naming a subset prints the same `Ran N tests` shape as one naming
;; all of them.
