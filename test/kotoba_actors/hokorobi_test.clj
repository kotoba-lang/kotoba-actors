  "RED spec for the hokorobi finance-risk graph actor. Pins the EXACT counts and
  the graph-closure invariant measured against the live seed. All assertions that
  exercise analysis fns go through the STUBS in kotoba-actors.hokorobi (which
  currently throw \"todo: ...\"), so the suite is RED by construction until kimi
  implements them. The final test exercises the engine `d/q` directly and is the
  only one expected to PASS while the stubs are unimplemented."
