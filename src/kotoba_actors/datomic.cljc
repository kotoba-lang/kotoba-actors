(ns kotoba-actors.datomic
  "A minimal, in-process kotoba-datomic-style substrate: turn kotoba-EDN entity
  rows into EAVT datoms, index them, and query them with a tiny datalog.

  This is the parallel-Clojure refactor of the Python actors' hand-rolled
  map-walking: instead of filtering vectors of maps, we model each fact as a
  datom [e a v] and answer questions with `q`. The Python actors are untouched.

  ── CONTRACT (the kotoba-code task is to implement every `todo` below) ────────
  A `db` is whatever `build-db` returns (an EAVT index of your choosing).
  `q` is a tiny conjunctive datalog: a query is

    {:find  [?sym ...]        ; symbols starting with ? are logic vars
     :where [[?e :attr ?v]    ; each clause is an [e a v] triple-pattern;
             [?e :a2 const]]} ; non-?-symbols / keywords / literals are constants

  `q` returns a SET of tuples (vectors), one per :find symbol, for every
  consistent binding of the where-clauses (joins share vars across clauses).

  ── ENGINE EXTENSIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - `_` is a WILDCARD in any clause position: it matches anything and binds
    nothing (use it for don't-care values instead of an unused ?var).
  - `q` accepts `:in [?x ...]` plus trailing input args, e.g.
    (q '{:find [?e] :in [?k] :where [[?e :organism/kind ?k]]} db :species)
  - EVERY row becomes datoms — a row WITHOUT a `*/id` key (edge / 縁 rows keyed
    on :en/from + :en/to) gets a deterministic synthetic entity id, so edges are
    first-class queryable datoms (no need to fall back to raw `load-rows`).

  ── PORTABILITY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  The engine — `rows->datoms`, `build-db`, `q` and everything private under
  them — is pure: rows in, datoms in, answers out, no host. The only host edge
  is `load-rows`, which reads a file, and it is a real one: unlike a registry
  library, this library's data is NOT in this repository (see
  `kotoba-actors.config`), so there is nothing here to compile in. The read is
  `slurp` on the JVM and `node:fs` under ClojureScript, and both take the
  ABSOLUTE path `kotoba-actors.config` hands them — not a path relative to the
  process's working directory, which is the trap a cwd-relative resource read
  falls into the moment the library stops being the root project.

  ── NIL IS NOT EMPTY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  `(reduce f {} nil)` yields `{}` and `(map-indexed f nil)` yields `()`, so a
  db built from rows that were never read would answer 0 to every count and
  `#{}` to every query — a complete-looking index over no data, indistinguishable
  from a graph that is genuinely empty. So: `load-rows` REFUSES a nil path
  rather than reading nothing; `rows->datoms` and `build-db` propagate nil; and
  `q` refuses a nil db. An empty db (`{}`, from an empty seed) still answers
  normally — the distinction being kept is between \"nothing there\" and
  \"nobody looked\"."

  :bom.edge/id). Every OTHER key/value in the row becomes a datom [e k v].
  A row WITHOUT any `*/id` key (edge / 縁 rows keyed on :en/from + :en/to) is
  given a deterministic synthetic id `:kotoba-actors.row/N` (N = row index) so
  its facts are still datoms — edges become first-class, queryable entities.

  Rows may additionally carry a Datomic/Datascript tx-data bookkeeping
  `:db/id` (a tempid, e.g. added by the repo-wide EDN->tx-data 'datomize' pass,
  manifest/edn-datomize.cljs) alongside their domain `*/id`. `:db/id` is
  intentionally EXCLUDED from `*/id`-key candidacy — `(name :db/id)` is \"id\"
  and would otherwise match `str/ends-with? … \"id\"` and get picked as the row's
  identity, replacing the real domain id (e.g. :organism/id's string value)
  with a numeric tempid and silently breaking id-based joins (e.g.
  kotoba-actors.tsugite/dangling-edges comparing node ids against 縁
  endpoint strings). It is also excluded from becoming a datom itself
