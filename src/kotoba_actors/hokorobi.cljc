  "hokorobi 綻び — systemic finance-risk graph analysis over the seed
  `seed-finrisk-graph.kotoba.edn`, refactored onto the kotoba-datomic
  EAVT/datalog substrate (kotoba-actors.datomic).

  ── SEED SHAPE (discovered, for the implementer) ─────────────────────────────
  The seed is a single top-level vector of entity maps. Two distinct kinds:

  NODES — every node row carries `:organism/id` (entity id) and
  `:organism/kind`, one of #{:institution :risk :bearer}. These rows ARE
  ingested into the db: `:organism/id` is the `*/id` key, so each other k/v of a
  node becomes a datom and is queryable with `d/q`. Counts in the live seed:
  institutions = 17, risk-sources = 6, bearers = 5 (28 nodes total).
  Institutions additionally carry :inst/sector :inst/sii :inst/jurisdiction.

  EDGES (縁) — edge rows carry `:en/from` `:en/to` `:en/kind` `:en/risk-load`
  `:en/sourcing` and have NO `*/id` key. IMPORTANT ENGINE FACT: because
  `d/rows->datoms` skips rows that have no key ending in \"id\", edge rows are
  NOT present in the db and CANNOT be reached through `d/q`. Edge-facing fns must
  read the raw rows via `d/load-rows` (the allowed I/O edge) and filter on
  `:en/from`. There are 31 edges in the live seed."
