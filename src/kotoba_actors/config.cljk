  "Resolution of actor-owned seed EDN from flat west sibling repositories.

  `KOTOBA_ACTORS_ETZHAYYIM_ROOT` may point at the directory containing the
  com-etzhayyim-* checkouts.  Otherwise the normal west layout is derived from
  this repository: orgs/kotoba-lang/kotoba-actors -> orgs/etzhayyim.

  ## Why this namespace is `.cljc` but still host-bound

  The rest of this library became portable by removing its runtime file
  access. This namespace cannot: it exists to name files, and the files it
  names are NOT in this repository. `storage-profile.edn` and `README.edn`
  say so on purpose — `:ownership :actor-repositories`,
  `:library-writes-actor-data false`. Compiling the seeds in, the way
  `kotoba-lang/technology` compiled its registry in, would copy another org's
  data into this repo and create exactly the two-sources-that-can-disagree
  defect that pattern exists to remove. So the seeds stay where they are and
  this namespace keeps a filesystem, on both runtimes.

  ## A resolver that cannot resolve must not answer

  The JVM branch derives the root from this source file's own location on the
  classpath, which is cwd-independent but assumes the west layout. Off that
  layout it produces a plausible-looking WRONG path rather than nothing —
  measured 2026-08-18: run from a `/tmp` worktree it yielded
  `/private/etzhayyim/com-etzhayyim-kabuto/...` and the suite reported 56
  errors that all read as missing data rather than as a bad root. That
  derivation is unchanged here (fixing it is a separate change), but the
  ClojureScript branch does NOT get an equivalent: there is no portable way
  to find a sibling checkout from a loaded namespace, so without the env var
  `etzhayyim-root` is nil and `actor-seed` returns nil rather than a path
  built out of a guess. `nil` propagates; a wrong path gets opened."
