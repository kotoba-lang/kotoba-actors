(ns kotoba-actors.inochi
  "inochi 命 — Clojure / kotoba-datomic refactor of the `inochi` biosphere actor.

  This namespace exposes the analysis surface over the inochi biosphere graph
  (species/ecosystem/biome/pressure NODES + 縁 EDGES) as datalog questions against
  the minimal `kotoba-actors.datomic` engine.

  SEED SHAPE (discovered from the real seed):
   * NODE rows carry an `:organism/id` (the entity id) and an `:organism/kind`
     keyword in #{:species :ecosystem :biome :pressure}.
   * EDGE rows carry NO `:organism/id`; their entity id is their first `*/id`-
     ending key — there is none, so the engine derives id from `:en/from`? NO:
     edges have `:en/from` + `:en/to` + `:en/kind` + `:en/grasping-load`. The
     engine's `rows->datoms` keys the entity off the first key whose name ends in
     \"id\"; edge rows have NO such key, so EDGE ROWS ARE NOT INDEXED AS DATOMS by
     the engine. (Implementer: confirm by querying — see contracts below.)

  Every analysis fn below is a STUB: it throws `ex-info` with a \"todo:\" message.
  kimi will implement each body so the RED test in
  `test/kotoba_actors/inochi_test.clj` turns GREEN."

  `db`. Instead read the raw rows (e.g. `(d/load-rows config/inochi-seed)`) and
  count rows where `:en/from` is present. (Or, if you change the ingest, keep the
